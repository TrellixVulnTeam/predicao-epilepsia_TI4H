abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient-based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

abstract = {Although recent advances in seizure anticipation have been achieved with the development of several biomathematical electroencephalographic (EEG) methods, pre-ictal clinical phenomena have not been extensively investigated. The aim of the study was to thoroughly analyze premonitory or prodromal symptoms (PS) in a randomly selected sample of 100 adult epileptic patients. A semi-structured protocol was used for in-person interviews to both patients and observers. PS were found in 39% of patients, the most frequent ones being behavioral, cognitive and mood changes. Both patients with focal and generalized epilepsies reported prodromes, although they were more frequently found in the former group. PS were mostly perceived preceding complex partial and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Prodromal symptoms were reported to have an insidious onset and their duration ranged from 30 min to several hours. The potential value of prodromes in seizure anticipation would allow the use of preventive and therapeutic measures, including drugs, neurostimulation procedures and behavioral intervention. {\textcopyright} 2008 British Epilepsy Association.},

	abstract = {Epilepsy is a chronic disorder of the central nervous system that predisposes individuals to experiencing recurrent seizures. It affects 3 million Americans and 50 million people world-wide. A seizure is a transient aberration in the brain's electrical activity that produces disruptive physical symptoms such as a lapse in attention and memory, a sensory hallucination, or a whole-body convulsion. Approximately 1 out of every 3 individuals with epilepsy continues to experience frequent seizures despite treatment with multiple anti-epileptic drugs. These intractable seizures pose a serious risk of injury, limit the independence and mobility of an individual, and result in both social isolation and economic hardship. This thesis presents novel technology intended to ease the burden of intractable seizures. At its heart is a method for computerized detection of seizure onset. The method uses machine learning to construct patient-specific classifiers that are capable of rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of seizure onset. The algorithm detects the onset of a seizure through analysis of the brain's electrical activity alone or in concert with other physiologic signals. When trained on 2 or more seizures and tested on 844 hours of continuous scalp EEG from 23 pediatric epilepsy patients, our algorithm detected 96% of 163 test seizures with a median detection delay of 3 seconds and a median false detection rate of 2 false detections per 24 hour period.(cont.) In this thesis we also discuss how our detector can be embedded within a low power, implantable medical device to enable the delivery of just-in-time therapy that has the potential to either eliminate or attenuate the clinical symptoms associated with seizures. Finally, we report on the in-hospital use of our detector to enable delay-sensitive therapeutic and diagnostic applications. We demonstrate the feasibility of using the algorithm to control the Vagus Nerve Stimulator (an implantable neuro stimulator for the treatment of intractable seizures), and to initiate ictal SPECT (a functional neuroimaging modality useful for localizing the cerebral site of origin of a seizure).},

	abstract = {Platelet aggregation and adhesion are critically involved in both normal hemostasis and thrombosis during vascular injury. Before any surgery, it is important to identify the number of platelets and their functionality to reduce the risk of bleeding; therefore, platelet function testing is a requirement. We introduce a novel evaluation method of assessing platelet function with laser speckle contrast imaging. The speckle decorrelation time (SDT) of the blood flowing through a microfluidic channel chip provides a quantitative measure of platelet aggregation. We compared SDTs of whole blood and platelet-poor blood, i.e., whole blood stripped of its buffy coat region, and found a marked reduction in decorrelation time for platelet-poor blood. The measured SDT of platelet-poor blood was 1.04 ± 0.21 ms, while that of whole blood was 2.64 ± 0.83 ms. To further characterize the sensitivity of our speckle decorrelation time-based platelet function testing (SDT-PFT), we added various agonists involved in platelet aggregation, including adenosine diphosphate (ADP), epinephrine (EPI), and arachidonic acid (AA). In this study, the results show that whole blood with ADP resulted in the largest SDT, followed by whole blood with AA, whole blood with EPI, whole blood without agonist, and platelet-poor blood with or without agonist. These findings show that SDT-PFT has the potential for rapid screening of bleeding disorders and monitoring of anti-platelet therapies with only a small volume of blood.},

In this article, we discuss construction of brain networks from connectivity data and describe the most commonly used network measures of structural and functional connectivity. We describe measures that variously detect functional integration and segregation, quantify centrality of individual brain regions or pathways, characterize patterns of local anatomical circuitry, and test resilience of networks to insult. We discuss the issues surrounding comparison of structural and functional network connectivity, as well as comparison of networks across subjects. Finally, we describe a Matlab toolbox (http://www.brain-connectivity-toolbox.net) accompanying this article and containing a collection of complex network measures and large-scale neuroanatomical connectivity datasets. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The electroencephalogram (EEG) is the most prominent means to study epilepsy and capture changes in electrical brain activity that could declare an imminent seizure. In this work, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are introduced in epileptic seizure prediction using EEG signals, expanding the use of deep learning algorithms with convolutional neural networks (CNN). A pre-analysis is initially performed to find the optimal architecture of the LSTM network by testing several modules and layers of memory units. Based on these results, a two-layer LSTM network is selected to evaluate seizure prediction performance using four different lengths of preictal windows, ranging from 15 min to 2 h. The LSTM model exploits a wide range of features extracted prior to classification, including time and frequency domain features, between EEG channels cross-correlation and graph theoretic features. The evaluation is performed using long-term EEG recordings from the open CHB-MIT Scalp EEG database, suggest that the proposed methodology is able to predict all 185 seizures, providing high rates of seizure prediction sensitivity and low false prediction rates (FPR) of 0.11–0.02 false alarms per hour, depending on the duration of the preictal window. The proposed LSTM-based methodology delivers a significant increase in seizure prediction performance compared to both traditional machine learning techniques and convolutional neural networks that have been previously evaluated in the literature.},
